# GolferGeek AI — Elevator Pitches

---

## For Small-Business Owners  
**Tagline**: *"Big-league AI, starter-team footprint."*

GolferGeek AI is a **consulting-ready** agent framework used by the GolferGeek team to deliver enterprise-grade AI automation to five-to-twenty-person organisations—without the enterprise price tag.  A concierge agent routes your requests—content writing, bookkeeping, customer-email triage—to specialist agents that tap Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MongoDB + Elasticsearch) and secure function calls.  You bring your own model/API key; the GolferGeek team installs, configures, and hands over a future-proof mono-repo so you can save ten hours a week today and scale tomorrow—no big-consultancy handshake required.

### How to Get Started
1. **Consulting-Assisted Deployment** – Work with the GolferGeek team to install and tailor the stack on your own cloud.
2. **Self-Hosted Starter Kit** – `git clone`, `docker compose up`, and keep all data in-house from day one.
3. **Fork & Extend / White-Label** – Rebrand or customise under the permissive licence while contributing fixes upstream.

## For College Students & Educators  
**Tagline**: *"Learn, build, deploy—one living lab."*

GolferGeek AI doubles as a semester-long playground where you explore cutting-edge LLM techniques hands-on.  Clone one mono-repo to run a Dockerised NestJS back-end, Vue front-end, and a fleet of agents using RAG, function-calling (MCP), and agent-to-agent planning.  Each module maps to incremental labs—from encrypting user-provided API keys to deploying on Fly.io—so students graduate having shipped production-grade AI, not just slide-deck theory.
